# BF4 Battlescreen Fix

A browser extension that restores the functionality of the Battlescreen feature in Battlelog for Battlefield 4 on PC. 
Since the creation of the Battlescreen, updates in browser security have broken the feature in its current implementation,
and DICE/EA haven't fixed it. This extension uses a simple workaround to get Battlescreen working again while staying compliant with
the latest browser security policies.

## Features

- **No configuration required**: Just install the extension, press the Battlescreen button in Battlelog while in-game on Battlefield 4,
and the Battlescreen will just work

- **Works in all major browsers**: Can be used in Firefox (preferred), Chrome, and other major browsers (Edge, Opera, etc.)

- **Safe and Secure**: Although the Battlescreen depends on an insecure connection, this extension wraps it and uses isolation and
safe browser communication mechanisms to make sure it works in the latest browser versions.

## Installation

[Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bf4-battlescreen-fix/)

[Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bf4-battlescreen-fix/miaabdkkbcileinfnlpdjgjlfjdmkada)
- Users of Edge, Opera, and other Chromium-based browsers can install the extension through the chrome web store

## Usage

1. Install the extension using one of the links above
2. Go to https://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/ while in a BF4 multiplayer game
    - You can join the server from Battlelog, or from the in-game server browser. Just make sure you're on the Battlelog web page while in the game.
3. Click on the Battlescreen button in the blue bar at the bottom of the page.
4. Play the game and use the Battlescreen on a second monitor to enhance your situational awareness

**Note**: 
- Only fixes Battlescreen for PC
- If the Battlescreen doesn't initially appear, try clicking the button again, or navigating to a different page in Battlelog then back to it. Because of the way the extension modifies the page, reloading it probably won't make it work.
